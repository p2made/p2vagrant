## `./vg n`

`Vagrantfile`s are generated as they are needed  by a script in the project root, `vg`  (for `Vagrantfile Generator`... works for me ðŸ™ƒ). `vg` takes one argument,  `n`, the step in this setup. So any `Vagrantfile` can be generated with...

```
./vg n
```

## Data

All of the data that defines this Vagrant machine is contained within `./provision/data/vagrantfiles_data.sh`, with one exception...

* The value of `VM_FOLDER` , `/var/www`, is stored in the two common functions files. This simplified matters enough to be worth the cost of the data duplication. Whan I have this project as a `v1.0.0` I may go back to look at changing this.

## Files

Apart from the `Vagrantfile `, all files you are directed to create are in...

```
/provision
    /data
    /etc
    /html
    /scripts
    /ssl
    /templates
    /vhosts
```
