Following are the steps taken to get to where I am. Because it's primarily for self-consumption explanations are little if any.

### `./vg n`

The file in the project root, `vg`, is a script to generate `Vagrantfile`s as they are needed (so the name means `Vagrantfile Generator`... works for me ðŸ™ƒ).

Where `n` is the step in this setup, the `Vagrantfile` for any step can be generated with...

```
./vg n
```

I plan to move the datawithin `vg` to a data file (which may itself be a script) in an update.

### Data

All of the data that defines this Vagrant machine ai contained within `./provision/scripts/vg.sh`, with two exceptions...

1. The value of `REMOTE_FOLDER` , `/var/www` is stored in the two common functions files. This simplified matters enough to be worth the cost of the data duplication. Whan I have this project as a `v1.0.0` I may go back to look at changing this.
2. Sites configuration data is stored in `./provision/data/sites_data`. This allows adding sites without editing the script.

### Files

Apart from the `Vagrantfile `, all files you are directed to create are in...

```
/provision
	/data
	/etc
	/html
	/scripts
	/ssl
	/templates
	/vhosts
```
