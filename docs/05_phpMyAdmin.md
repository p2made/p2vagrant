### Accessing the Database from Outside the VM

To access your database with a GUI you'll need to use a SSH connection. How to set this up depends on the software you're using, but in general these are the things you'll need to configure:

Item | Value
---- | -----
`Host` | 127.0.0.1
`Username` | myuser (which we've defined in mysql.sh)
`Password` | password (which we've also defined in mysql.sh)
`SSH Host` | 127.0.0.1
`SSH User` | vagrant
`SSH Key` | Can be found in this location in your project directory: /.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
`SSH Port` | 2222
