Usage: ./p2v [-g] [-r] [-v] <integer>
Options:
  -g    Generate Vagrantfile based on the passed integer.
  -r    Reset: Delete any generated or copied files from earlier Vagrant provisioning.
  -v    run `vagrant up [--provision]` as appliciable.
  <integer>   Step number for Vagrantfile generation.
--
Usage examples:
  ./p2v <integer>       # Generate Vagrantfile based on the passed integer.
  ./p2v -g <integer>    # Generate Vagrantfile based on the passed integer.
  ./p2v -r <integer>    # Reset and generate Vagrantfile based on the passed integer.
  ./p2v -gr <integer>   # Reset and generate Vagrantfile based on the passed integer.
  ./p2v -v <integer>    # Do `-g` then run `vagrant up [--provision]` as appliciable.
  ./p2v -gv <integer>   # Do `-g` then run `vagrant up [--provision]` as appliciable.
  ./p2v -rv <integer>   # Do `-gr` then run `vagrant up [--provision]` as appliciable.
  ./p2v -grv <integer>  # Do `-gr` then run `vagrant up [--provision]` as appliciable.

  -g is implied any time a valid integer argument is given, so only serves as
     'syntactic sugar' to make the intended use of `./p2v` explicitly clear.

Order of operations:
  - `-r` if set
  - `-g` always
  - `-v` if set

Before using p2v you must run `./p2v -init` to ensure that all necessary software is
installed and that there is an initial prefs file in place. Once p2v is initialised
you can customise your VM settings by editing `./provision/data/p2v_prefs.yaml`.

More comprehensive documentarian can be found in `./docs/p2v_App.md`.
